# FRIENDS Quiz

My quiz is a game to challenge yourself or others with your knowledge of the very popular show, Friends. Some people might just think they know all about the series. Well, here's a good way to test yourself. The questions will be generated randomly with 5 questions. You have to make sure you get all 5 correct. You score will be record and stored for you final result at the end. 

Users playing this game will be able to understand the rules at the bottom of the screen as well as choosing wisely. The site is aimed at anybody who's seen the show therefore not demographic. Challenge yourself and have fun!

#### Results

- When the user clicks an option, the answer will light up either red or green. This determines your answer.

- The Javascript code chooses a random question and is displayed. Based on your answer, you can move on to the next stage of questions or get an incorrect score to show you your final result at the end.




#### The Footer

- The footer section is fixed to the bottom showing rules. This is in a different color so that people can clearly see it. 

- The footer is most important as some might  struggle to understand.

#### Features to Implement

- When time is available, I would like to add a greater variety in questions and also a leaderboard at the end. This could show all the people playing and who's got the highest score.

## Testing 

- I tested this game in Chrome, Firefix and Opera.

- I can confirm the results of the game are always correct.

- The header, instructions, options, results and footer and very easy to understand and read. 

- The colors and fonts are chosen which are easy to read and accessible when running it through lighthouse in the devtool.
